# AirBnB Clone

## Description

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is the first step towards building a full web application that mimics the functionality of AirBnB. The focus of this phase is to create a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows you to perform various operations on AirBnB objects. These operations include creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing actions on objects, updating attributes, and destroying objects.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script in your terminal.

### bash
$ ./console.py

## Main Concepts

AirBnB clone architecture
OOP principles
Unit testing
Serialization and deserialization
